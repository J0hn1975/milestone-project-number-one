User Centric Milestone One Project

1. This is a website based on one of my favourtie bands The Small Faces. 

Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
1. A standard nav bar is used to navigate around website which is visible on all devices above 600px. Also, clicking on 'The Small Faces' brings the user back to the homepage.
For all devices under 600px the nav bar collaspses in to a hamburber style drop down menu, the nav becomes visible when clicking on the hamburger icon.
I have made the drop down nav menu opaque so that the pages remain visible under the menu, so that the content can still be seen
For mobile devices the main colour image on the homepage changes to a back and white one. 

Colour Scheme.
1. Mods or Mod culture adopted the colours of the RAF target insignia which is reflected throughout the site.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Technologies Used
1. CSS
2. HTML
3. Bootstrap 3.3.7

Testing
1. HTML for entire site validated  "Nu HTML Checker" - https://validator.w3.org/
2. CSS for entire site validated https://jigsaw.w3.org/
3. Both CSS and HTML ran thhrough cleaners to tidy up code.


In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section hould describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
